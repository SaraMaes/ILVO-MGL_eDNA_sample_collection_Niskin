### Glossary

| SPECIALISED TERM | DEFINITION |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) sensor | Sensor used to measure temperature, conductivity and pressure. Additional sensors are often attached to the frame of the deployable CTD frame (oxygen, chlorophyll, pH, etc.) to collect additional data. Often, niskin bottles are attached to the same deployable metal frame as the CTD and ancilliary sensors so that water parameter data are collected alongside niskin water samples. Deployments of this suite of instruments and sensors on the same frame is often referred to as a "CTD cast". |
| Field blank | Sampling negative control. Typically distilled or reverse osmosis water run through a filter like a seawater eDNA sample to control for contamination in the field sampling step.  |
| Niskin bottle  | Plastic cylindrical bottle of varying volumes for collecting discrete water samples. A stopper at each end of the bottle can be "cocked" open with an electronic or weight triggered release mechanism causing the stoppers to snap shut. This is remotely triggered so the bottle closes at a prescribed depth. Often, multiple bottles are arranged on the same frame as a CTD and other sensors in a "rosette". |
|CTD cast| refers to the lowering and raising of a CTD instrument into the sea to make profiles of conductivity, temperature and depth.

## BACKGROUND

This document describes the protocol to collect seawater with Niskin bottles for eDNA analyses. At ILVO, we have been collecting eDNA water samples since 2019, and have modified our collection protocol based on practical experience onboard the research vessels and on sequencing results from various campaigns. This version of the protocol has been developped in the framework of the eDNAqua-Plan project which aims to make eDNA datasets FAIR. 

### Summary

This protocol is intended to perform eDNA analyses to assess marine biodiversity patterns in the Belgian part of the North sea; the geographical area is a shallow marine system, with water depths ranging between 7 and 30 m. There is no halocline and water is well mixed in this area. Previous research has shown that biodiversity patterns assessed with surface (1 m below surface) or bottom (1-3m above seafloor) samples are similar (Dukan et al. 2024). Consequently, seawater sample collection is done at one depth, between 1 and 3 m above the seafloor, to increase detection of epibenthic species. 

### Method Description and Rationale

This protocol uses Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD rosette onboard a research vessel to collect seawater. In each sample location, five Niskin bottles are filled with seawater collected at a depth of 1 to 3 m above the seafloor. From each Niskin bottle, a subsample of 2L is collected. The number of Niskin bottles in a location has been determined based on collecting 10 Niskin bottles in five stations located in known fish communities (coastal, transition and offshore). 12S metabarcoding results showed an increased number of fishes detected with increasing number of replicates. A trade-off between sampling effort and maximal detection of the common fishes led to the collection of 5 bottles to adequately describe fish biodiversity patterns. If rare species are also of interest, then more Niskin bottles should be collected. Increasing the number to 10 bottles leads on average to the detection of four extra species. Depending on the research vessel, further processing is done in a separate lab onboard (RV Belgica) or in the lab at ILVO (Simon Stevin). This processing involves filtering of the water using sterivex 0.45Âµm capsule filters, which are then used for eDNA extraction and metabarcoding. 

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

This protocol has been applied for hundreds of samples collected in the southern North Sea. Samples have been collected in the belgian part of the North Sea during spring and autumn campaigns since 2021 at various distances from shore (coastal, transition and offshore locations). This protocol is also applied for surveys in the southern bight of the North Sea (maximum depth 50 m). All samples are taken in the photic zone and are situated in the neritic pelagic zone. 

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One technician or scientist with experience in sterile and clean working and with research vessel experience. 

### Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions including wearing PPE should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to bleach and ethanol.

### Training Requirements

Training for working onboard a research vessel and for working sterile is required to conduct this protocol. Experience with going to sea and sample collection under seagoing conditions is encouraged, at a minimum personel should be trained to handle the CTD software before the first deployment at sea.

### Time Needed to Execute the Procedure

The time needed varies based on the number and type of samples collected. For a majority of our sampling, five niskin bottles on a CTD rosette are triggered to collect sea water at one depth (e.g., 1-3 m off bottom depending on the weather conditions). Then a singular sample is collected from each niskin. A cast in the southern Bight of the North Sea is at most 50 m deep and takes roughly 10 minutes (including 3 minutes of calibration time subsurface for the CTD sensors). Collecting a 2L subsample from one niskins take between 2-5 minutes, depending on access and size of the Niskin bottle (larger botlles are faster to subsample because there is more pressure on the water to flow out of the Niskin spout/spigot). The total collection time for a singular cast with five niskins triggered and one sample taken from each niskin is 35 minutes on average.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

In the following SOP, please use the exact names of equipment as noted in the table above.

Provide a step-by-step description of the protocol. The identification of difficult steps in the protocol and the provision of recommendations for the execution of those steps are encouraged.

### Preparation
**before embarking**
Prefilter sterilization: 
Preprinted labels: 
Digital cruise report file:

**Immediately before sampling**

Glove Sterilization: Sterile nitrile gloves must be worn at all times during the sterilization, sampling, filtering, preservation and storage steps. Gloves directly from the box are not considered sterile. To sterilize, put on a new pair of gloves, squirt 10% bleach solution from a squirt bottle onto the gloves and rub hands together, then squirt with EtOH to get rid of bleach residue.  

2L commercial drinking water bottles: label five 2L bottles with the pre-printed labels (NameStation_ReplicateNumber) onto the side of the bottles and write down the location and date on the bottle itself with the markerâ¯ 

Niskin bottles: open six bottles at the top and ensure the rosette is balanced (choose three bottles in front of each other), close the bottom stopper and close the faucet; pour 2L drinking water in each Niskin bottle and immediately close the empty plastic bottle; open the faucet to flush it with the drinking water; afterwards, open the bottom stopper to remove the remaining water.â¯ 

### Sampling

This protocol is designed for samples collected with a niskin bottle - the samples are expected to be discrete and sealed masses of water that can be transferred to a 1 L Nalgene bottle without contamination (typically from the spout/spigot of the niskin bottle). For our samples, niskin bottles are remotely triggered to close at a specified depth and collected alongside complementary hydrographic data (using a CTD attached to the niskin sampling rosette). 

Fill 2 L plastic bottle with 2 L of seawater. It is important to do this before the sample seawater has sat on the deck in the sun. After collecting, if you donât have time to filter, label and store bottles in the fridge (4ËC) for up to 12 hours (>4 hours is not ideal), or in the freezer (-20Â°C)if filtering will be done later. Note the length of time a seawater sample sits in the fridge/freezer in the cruise report.

Please specify how you collected samples and note what equipment you used to do so (e.g. targeted water mass, volume, sampling equipment, replication).
